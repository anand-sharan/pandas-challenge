2. Please find the steps of Pandas homework solution:

    PyBankPyCitySchools.ipynb in PyCitySchools folder
    --------------------------------
    Jupyter Notebook for analyzing the City Schools and Students data of a company.

    Please check the following link to view the Jupyter Notebook on the GitHub:

    https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anand-sharan/pandas-challenge/blob/master/PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools.ipynb
    
    Resources folder
    ---------------------
    Provided with school data set schools_complete.csv. The dataset is composed of columns: School ID,school_name,type,size,budget.
    
    Provided with school data set students_complete.csv. The dataset is composed of columns: Student ID,student_name,gender,grade,school_name,reading_score,math_score.

    The Jupyter notebook PyCitySchools.ipynb script analyzes the school and students records calculates each of the following:

3. District Summary
   -------------------
    * Calculate the total number of schools

    * Calculate the total number of students

    * Calculate the total budget

    * Calculate the average math score

    * Calculate the average reading score

    * Calculate the percentage of students with a passing math score (70 or greater)

    * Calculate the percentage of students with a passing reading score (70 or greater)

    * Calculate the percentage of students who passed math and reading (% Overall Passing)

    * Create a dataframe to hold the above results

    * Optional: give the displayed data cleaner formatting

4. Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
---------------------------------------------------
        * Sort and display the top five performing schools by % overall passing.

    Steps to validate the solution: Check output on Out[26] to be validated with Out[10] output

    Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
        * Sort and display the five worst-performing schools by % overall passing.

    Steps to validate the solution: Check output on Out[28] to be validated with Out[11] output

5. Math Scores by Grade
---------------------------------------------------

        * Create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

        * Create a pandas series for each grade. Hint: use a conditional statement.

        * Group each series by school

        * Combine the series into a dataframe

        * Optional: give the displayed data cleaner formatting        

    Steps to validate the solution: Check output on Out[34] to be validated with Out[12] output

6. Reading Score by Grade
---------------------------------
        * Perform the same operations as above for reading scores

    Steps to validate the solution: Check output on Out[40] to be validated with Out[13] output

7. Scores by School Spending
----------------------------------
    * Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student)* Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:
    * Average Math Score
    * Average Reading Score
    * % Passing Math
    * % Passing Reading
    * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

   Steps to validate the solution: Check output on Out[46] to be validated with Out[18] output

8. Scores by School Size
-----------------------------
    * Perform the same operations as above, based on school size.

   Steps to validate the solution: Check output on Out[51] to be validated with Out[22] output

9. Scores by School Type
----------------------------
    * Perform the same operations as above, based on school type

   Steps to validate the solution: Check output on Out[54] to be validated with Out[24] output

10. Request for you gracious feedback.
